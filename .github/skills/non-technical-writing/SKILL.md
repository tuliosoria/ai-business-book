# Non-Technical Writing for Business Audiences

This skill covers writing technical content for business professionals who will never write code but need to make smart decisions.

## Target Audience

| Audience | Reading Level | What They Know | What They DON'T Know |
|----------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| C-suite executives | Harvard Business Review | Strategy, P&L, leadership | APIs, models, training data |
| Department heads | Wall Street Journal | Team management, budgets | Machine learning vs. deep learning |
| Product managers | Fast Company | Roadmaps, user stories | Neural networks, fine-tuning |
| Operations leaders | McKinsey reports | Process optimization | Python, JSON, prompt engineering |

**Assumed knowledge:** Business fundamentals (ROI, KPIs, stakeholder management)  
**Assumed ignorance:** Anything requiring a computer science degree

## Content Philosophy

1. **No code, ever.** Not even pseudocode. Exception: simple English prompt templates.
2. **Honest about limitations.** Technology fails. Say so. No hype.
3. **ROI-first framing.** Every concept tied to business value.
4. **Decision frameworks over features.** Not "here's what it can do" but "here's how to decide if it fits."
5. **Real examples from real industries.** Banking, healthcare, retail—not software companies.

**Tone:** Authoritative but accessible. Like a trusted consultant, not a professor or salesperson.

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Do vs Don't

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|-------|---------|
| Use business language | Use technical jargon |
| Give concrete ROI examples | Make vague claims |
| Acknowledge limitations | Oversell capabilities |
| Provide actionable frameworks | Give abstract theory |
| Include exercises | Leave readers passive |
| Use specific numbers | Use weasel words |

### Example Transformations

**Technical (Bad):**
> "The transformer architecture uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data with O(n²) complexity."

**Business (Good):**
> "Modern AI systems can understand context in ways older systems couldn't—like knowing 'bank' means different things in 'river bank' versus 'bank account.' This matters because your customer service AI won't confuse inquiries."

---

**Technical (Bad):**
> "Fine-tune the model on your domain-specific corpus to improve accuracy."

**Business (Good):**
> "Think of it like training a new employee: generic AI knows general knowledge, but you'll get better results after it learns your company's specific terminology and common customer questions."

## ROI Framing

Always connect concepts to business value:

```
"This saves 4 hours/week per analyst"
"Reduces customer wait time from 3 minutes to 45 seconds"
"Calculate ROI: (Time saved × hourly rate) - AI tool cost"
```

### ROI Formula Template

```
Before: [X] hours/week × [Y] employees × $[Z]/hour = $[Total] weekly cost
After:  [X'] hours/week × [Y] employees × $[Z]/hour = $[Total'] weekly cost
Savings: $[Difference] per week = $[Annual] per year
Tool cost: $[Cost]/year
Net ROI: $[Annual savings - Cost] = [X]% return
```

## Business Examples to Use

**Good (Business Context):**
- "A regional bank reduced loan processing time by 40%..."
- "Your marketing team can segment customers automatically..."
- "The HR department now screens 500 resumes in the time it took to review 50..."
- "Manufacturing floor managers get alerts before equipment fails..."

**Bad (Technical Context):**
- "The neural network uses backpropagation..."
- "Here's a Python script that..."
- "Configure the API endpoint..."
- "The model achieved 94.7% F1 score..."

## Explaining Technical Concepts

### The Analogy Method

| Technical Concept | Business Analogy |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Training data | "Teaching materials for a new hire" |
| Model fine-tuning | "Specializing a generalist employee" |
| Hallucination | "Confidently wrong, like an overconfident intern" |
| Prompt engineering | "Learning how to ask the right questions" |
| API | "A phone number for software to call other software" |
| Tokens | "The AI equivalent of reading words" |

### The "So What?" Test

After every explanation, ask: "So what? Why does this matter to my reader's job?"

If you can't answer, either:
1. Add the business implication
2. Cut the explanation (it's not needed)

## Chapter Arc for Busy Executives

1. **Hook (1 page):** Relatable business problem or surprising statistic
2. **Context (2-3 pages):** Why this matters NOW for their business
3. **Framework (3-5 pages):** Core mental model or decision process
4. **Application (3-5 pages):** Real-world examples from non-tech industries
5. **Pitfalls (1-2 pages):** What goes wrong and how to avoid it
6. **Action items (1 page):** Specific next steps for Monday morning

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] No code or technical syntax
- [ ] Every technical term is defined or analogized
- [ ] At least one ROI/business value statement per section
- [ ] Examples from non-software industries
- [ ] Actionable takeaways (what to DO, not just know)
- [ ] Honest about limitations and risks
- [ ] Passes the "CEO on a flight" test: readable and actionable
