# Hello React (Vite)

This is a minimal "Hello, world!" React app scaffolded with Vite.

Run the app (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Tulio\Desktop\ai-business-book"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The dev server will print a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
- To build for production: `npm run build` and preview with `npm run preview`.

If you prefer TypeScript or Create React App instead, tell me and I can re-scaffold.
